### Working Features

1. An API backend that:
   1. Provides weather data by interpreting OpenWeatherMap's API information.
   2. Classifies images of clothing by the type of clothes (i.e. top, shoes, pullover, pants) and removes the background of the image.
2. A mobile application that shows basic info on the local weather.

#### Trying out the API

To try out the clothing classification and processing API endpoint, check out these [instructions](./backend/instructions/AI-clothes-cURL.md).
